# Guide
The blueprint repository for the Kovan Github. This repository is made to agree on GitHub, project development and code documentation. It consists from documentation files such as Doxygen html and guide Python codes for Doxygen and Sphinx documentation. Codes has example comments to explain comment tags and comment styles. The repository has a Wiki page which includes more comprehensive discussions on conventions. In fact, README.md of the repository only explains how to arrange the Readme file for a Kovan project repository. For further information on other concepts, one should examine guide codes, issues and wiki page.

# Features

Shortly describe the project's features and To-Do.

* Describe a project outline
* Define comment style

**ToDo:**
* Add a wiki page
* Add badges
* Add command line command as example
* Add code segments as example

# Prerequisites

**Note:** Other name proposals are Background, Libraries, Technologies

If necessary, list used library, language and framework versions. Version differences makes installation really harder if there is a mismatch. Add any permission requirement if exists. As a motivation, it is said that listing used technologies grabs the recruiters' attention since they have limited time to search candidate.

* Python 2.7
* pip >= 19.3

# Installation

List Installation steps. Mention encountered errors.

Add a command line command of usage and add an output if possible
